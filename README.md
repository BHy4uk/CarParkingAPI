Inheritance Challenge 2 - Employees, Bosses and Trainees
Create a main class with the Main Method, then a base class Employee with the properties Name, FirstName, Salary, and the methods Work() and Pause().

Create a deriving class boss with the property CompanyCar and the method Lead().  Create another deriving class of employees - trainees with the properties WorkingHours and SchoolHours and a method Learn().

Override the methods Work() of the trainee class so that it indicates the working hours of the trainee.

Donâ€™t forget to create constructors.

Create an object of each of the three classes (with arbitrary values)

and call the methods, Lead() of Boss and Work() of Trainee.

Just print out the respective text, what the respective employees do.
E.g. Lead() should print out something like. I'm leading. It is up to you what you print out.

Imagine you are a developer and get a job in which you need to create a program for a teacher. He needs a program written in c# that calculates the average score of his students. So he wants to be able to enter each score individually and then get the final average score once he enters -1.
So the tool should check if the entry is a number and should add that to the sum. Finally once he is done entering scores, the program should write onto the console what the average score is.
The numbers entered should only be between 0 and 20. Make sure the program doesn't crash if the teacher enters an incorrect value.
